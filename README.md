## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a physicist and computer scientist passionate about Neuroscience and Data Science. 

- Iâ€™m currently pursuing my PhD in Cognitive Computational Neuroscience at the University of Bern, Switzerland. My work focuses on characterizing brain functions (e.g., recognizing a song) from neural activity recordings obtained in epilepsy patients.

- Previously, I completed two internships in the pharmaceutical industry, at Roche and Johnson&Johnson. I am passionate about translating research findings into a clinical context.
